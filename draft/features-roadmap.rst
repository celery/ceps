Abstract
========

This CEP details the roadmap for planned new features and breaking changes for Celery NextGen.
The description of these features is done in other CEPs. If one is available, we will provide a link to the matching CEP.
Otherwise, we will link to an issue which describes the motivation behind the feature or breaking change.

The document will be updated from time to time whenever we intend to release new major versions of Celery.
